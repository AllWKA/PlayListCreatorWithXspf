# Game With Friends.

Do you remember that serie or movie that you always wanted your freinds to see and you always insist?, well you can be a pain in the neck!, same as me so I propoused them a game to my friends:
Everyone will chose 3 apisodes of an serie that always insist in we have to see it and let the random choose the order, so everyone will suffer the serie of everyone!
Is actually funny when you choose a weird serie and you see your friends suffer.
